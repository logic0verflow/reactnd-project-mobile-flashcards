# UdaciFlash Mobile Flashcard Project

This repository is a project submission for Udacity's React Nanodegree course
was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
The project aims to provide a smart phone app containing decks of flashcards
the user has created. It should allow the user to take quizzes of the decks to
review the material.

## Preparations

The project is being developed using the following software versions

* npm 5.5.1

These tools are needed to continue below.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

* In a terminal window, install and start the development environment
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
* Once the packager has been started, you can either use the Expo app available
for iOS and Android devices to scan the QR code that will be displayed or use
a device emulator.
